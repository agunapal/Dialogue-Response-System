# Dialogue Response System

Our goal is to design a single response system for a given context , as an exploration into how an Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (HRED) model proposed by Serban et al. (2016)[1]  could provide the building block to a more robust chatbot system.The HRED model [2] uses a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and has additional functionality to remember the context.

We plan to score our HRED model using perplexity scores against the ngram/Knesser-Ney which should have a much more limited context. 

We are using the movie dialogues corpus (Movie-DiC) as our main dataset as this was used in [1].  This is a corpus scraped from the internet movie script data collection.  The dialogue corpus contains 132,229 dialogues containing a total of 764,146 turns which have been extracted from 753 movies [3]. This dataset cannot be made public and hence we are making our github repository public.
